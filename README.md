# D-0 Droid Replica
This reposiory houses the code and building instruction for a replica of the Star Wars droid D-0 featured in Episode IX. This is an in-progress project that will be complete when the build instructions have been completed

The goals of this droid re-creation were as follows:
1. Ensure that an intermediate to advanced hobbyist can create this replica
2. To implement as much functionality shown in Episode IX as possible while following goal 1.

There was some functionality that had to be sacrificed to ensure that the second goal was met. This was limited to the following areas:
 - The head does not have the degree of freedom shown in the movie allowing it to "nod" relative to the plate that the head and neck are mounted to. The current design focuses on the "swivel" and "tilt" motions of the head since the "nod" motion can also be accomplished using the fourbar mechanism that effectively "nods" the plate and head assembly. This isn't to say that it is impossible to do while complying with goal 1, it was just sacrificed in this design. 
  - The playable sounds were limited to the most versitile ones from the movie. This excluded pieces of dialogue that might not be useful to keep the number of options found in the scroll wheel reasonable.
  - Although care was taken to keep the asthetics, detail, and scale as similar to the movie as possible, there is limited information available on D-0 compared to other Star Wars droids. On the asthetics side, the goal was to keep the design true enough to the source material that it would require fairly intensive searching to find inconsistencies.
  - There may be additional areas where the design does not match what is shown in Episode IX. Feel free to point out any differences you can find!
